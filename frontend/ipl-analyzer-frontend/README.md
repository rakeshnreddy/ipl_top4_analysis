# IPL Analyzer Frontend

This directory contains the React frontend for the IPL Qualification Probability Analyzer. It is built using Vite, React, and TypeScript.

## Overview

The frontend provides an interactive user interface to display IPL team standings, qualification probabilities, detailed team analysis, and allows users to simulate scenarios. It features a dynamic, warm-toned theme with light and dark modes and glassmorphism effects. Data is primarily fetched from JSON files generated by the backend Python scripts.

## Key Features

*   **Dynamic Theming**: Light and dark mode support with a warm-toned color palette.
*   **Interactive UI**: Allows users to select teams, view probabilities, and simulate match outcomes.
*   **Data Visualization**: Presents standings and probability data in clear tables and charts.
*   **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes.

## Tech Stack

*   **Framework/Library**: React
*   **Build Tool**: Vite
*   **Language**: TypeScript
*   **Styling**: CSS with Custom Properties (main styles in `src/index.css` and `src/custom-styles.css`)
*   **Charting**: Chart.js (via `react-chartjs-2`) for probability visualizations.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend/ipl-analyzer-frontend
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    It's recommended to use `npm ci` for cleaner installs based on the `package-lock.json` if it's a project you're checking out. Otherwise, `npm install` will work.
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # npm ci 
    ```

## Development Server

To start the development server (usually on `http://localhost:5173`):

```bash
npm run dev
```
The application uses Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for a fast development experience.

## Building for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```
The build artifacts will be placed in the `dist/` directory.

## Environment Variables

*   **`VITE_API_BASE_URL` (Implicitly `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`)**: Vite handles this automatically. For development, it defaults to `/`. For production builds, ensure your server serves the static files correctly or configure the `base` option in `vite.config.ts` if deploying to a subdirectory.
*   The application fetches data files (`analysis_results.json`, `current_standings.json`) relative to this base URL. For local development, these files should be placed in the `frontend/ipl-analyzer-frontend/public/` directory to be accessible. Python scripts in the root of the project generate these files; they need to be copied into the frontend's `public` directory after generation.

## Linting and Formatting

This project is set up with ESLint. To lint your code:
```bash
npm run lint
```
